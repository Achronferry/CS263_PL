# CS263_PL
The final work for programming language
## Midterm report
> Due date: June 4. Every team leader should send your latest version (one or more Coq files) to the instructor via email. It should at least contain necessary definitions and your theorem's statement.

## Topic: Semantic equivalence for programs with break and continue (additional for, do while, while)
> You should first define a Hoare logic, a denotational semantics and a small step semantics for a programming language with break and continue. Then you need to prove the equivalence between small step semantics and denotational semantics. Also, you should prove the soundness theorem of Hoare logic.
